My name is Amirmasoud, I'm a passionate Computer Engineer with a foundation and experience in Cybersecurity and Computer Networks. Iâ€™m interested in both offensive and defensive security. Solving the complex challenges of security problems in realâ€‘world situations piques my interest.

Due to lack of official cybersecurity training institutes and security/privacy university curriculum I had to overcome many challenges and difficulties and delve into the cybersecurity self study path.
